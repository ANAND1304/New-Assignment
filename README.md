## ✅ Problem Descriptions

### **Problem-1: Calculator using Class**
A simple calculator program built using a Java class.  
It takes:
- input **a** (double)  
- input **b** (double)  
- **operation type** (String → add / sub / mul / div)  
and prints the result based on the selected operation.

### **Problem-2: Generate odd number series up to N**
For a given integer **a**, print odd numbers from **1** till the **a-th odd number**.  
Example:  
- a = 4 → output: `1, 3, 5, 7`

---

### **Problem-3: Conditional odd number pattern**
For a given integer **a**:
- If **a is odd → print odd numbers up to the a-th odd number**
- If **a is even → print odd numbers up to (a-1)-th odd number**

Example:  
- a = 4 → output: `1, 3, 5`  
- a = 5 → output: `1, 3, 5, 7, 9`

### **Problem-4: Count numbers divisible by 1 to 9**
Given a list of integers, count how many numbers are divisible by:  
`1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9`

Example input:  
`[1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]`

Expected output:  
`{1:11, 2:8, 3:4, 4:4, 5:3, 6:2, 7:0, 8:1, 9:1}`
